Dynamic Consumable Bar — Design Contract (Beta)
1. Purpose

This addon provides a role-first, context-aware consumable action bar for WoW Classic / TBC that reduces cognitive load under pressure while remaining predictable, deterministic, and fully compliant with Blizzard’s UI and automation policies.

The addon assists decision-making but never automates gameplay.

2. Core Principles

Player Intent First: Buttons represent capabilities, not fixed items.

Trust Over Cleverness: Behavior must be explainable and stable.

No Automation: The addon never performs actions without explicit player input.

Combat Safety: No layout or meaning changes during combat.

WoW ToS Compliance: No protected actions are automated or conditionally triggered.

3. Bar Structure

Single bar, maximum 12 buttons

Dynamic footprint: Only relevant buttons appear

Role-first ordering (urgency → convenience)

Visually flat (beta): no skins, separators, or visual grouping

Role-First Order (Conceptual)

Emergency Conversion (Healthstone, Dark Rune, etc.)

Health Potions

Mana Potions

Battle Elixir

Guardian Elixir

Flask

Bandages

Food / Drink (prep only)

Quest / Contextual Items

Weapon Buffs / Oils

Misc Utility

Hearthstone (always last)

Low-urgency buttons never float ahead of higher-urgency groups.

4. Modes (Implicit)

The bar operates in two implicit modes:

Battle Mode

Active only while in combat

Contents:

Emergency Conversion

Health Potions

Mana Potions

(Optional) Bandages

Frozen layout and meaning

No reflow, no reassignment

Prep Mode

Active out of combat

Expanded contents (buffs, food, utility)

Reflow allowed

Item reassignment allowed

Mode switching is implicit (no indicators in beta).

5. Button Behavior

Buttons may change assigned item only out of combat

Buttons never change meaning mid-combat

A button may exist in one mode and not the other

All actions require explicit player input (click or keybind)

6. Unusable Actions

Relevant but temporarily unusable actions are shown greyed-out

Greyed-out buttons:

Cannot be clicked

Cannot fire via keybind

Are informational only

Buttons are hidden entirely if the player lacks the capability (e.g., no item in bags)

Greyed-out means “not now”, never “not configured”.

7. Profiles

Per-character profiles only

Optional Copy-From-Profile action

One-time copy

No live linking

No account-wide shared profiles in beta

8. Ace3 Usage Policy

Ace3 may be used only for:

SavedVariables / profiles

Options UI

Slash commands

Debug toggles

Ace3 must never:

Drive combat logic

Select items

Control secure actions

Influence protected behavior

Core logic must remain Ace-independent.

9. World of Warcraft ToS / UI Policy Compliance

This addon explicitly avoids all prohibited behaviors, including but not limited to:

❌ No automatic item use

❌ No conditional execution of protected actions

❌ No combat decision automation

❌ No reading or reacting to protected state to fire actions

❌ No secure attribute changes in combat

✔ All actions require a hardware event
✔ All logic resolves before the click
✔ Secure templates and Blizzard-approved APIs only
✔ Behavior mirrors Blizzard default UI constraints

If Blizzard’s default UI could not legally perform the action, this addon will not either.
